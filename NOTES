urgent task:
	[ ] error management {perror("malloc");
  							exit(EXIT_FAILURE);}
	[x] should add a global struct which will contain the exit status of commands
	[x] creat function destroy env to free t_env
	[ ] fix the double erreur display in this case "minishell:$> >"
	[x] added .gitignore file, add files u don't need to push to avoid unnecessary conflicts

	[x]do redirection in all types(Parcinf fase)
	[x]replace ast with a simple list only (t_cmd)
	[x]fix the problem where u need to keep argument type (is it from "" or '' or $, not "$"-> is from "" ...)
	[x]Expand variables in here doc
	[x]Expand env using our one env (it must be a linked list [key = "", value = ""])
normal task: 
	[ ] fix norminette
	[ ] fix leaks if there is 
	[ ] fix all erreur printf to print in stderror
	[ ] fix this cases : bash3-2$ ls 1>/dev/NULL
	[ ] organize the working directory [include->libft + others if neccessary; in src-> seperate each step to it folder]
notes : i made a expand_issue file to fix the problems like:(made bye hsaktiwy)
	$a = "ls -la"
	$b = "| wc -l"
	bash-3.2$ $a
	output : 
		total 168

	bash-3.2$ $a $b
	output :
		ls: -l: No such file or directory
		ls: wc: No such file or directory
		ls: |: No such file or directory
	the problem is that we will need to be carfull about this cases
	bash-3.2$ $a "$b"
	output:
		ls: | wc -l: No such file or directory
	where in this case we will need to identifie the diffrence between a argument where it was walled bye \' \" and where there is just simple $variables

	plus i linked the extra argument that apear in this wierd cases :
	case1 : 
	bash-3.2$ ls -la << here_doc > output file
		> jshdja
		> asjkdga
		> kk
		> here_doc
		ls: file: No such file or directory
	where the 'file' input in the case1 will behave like a argument for our first detected commad

COMMAND THAT DOESN'T WORK:
[ ]ls -la "|"

NOTE= "You can devide task needed to be done to 2 type urgent one and the normale one"

REPORTS: add a report if u find some bugs or something here pls 

List_CMD: linked->token->t_cmd 
Linked_T_CMD :  linked->t_file->a_file


### my notes don't mind them

+export with no args prints all env
+KEY is invalid if it starts with anything rather than a-z A-Z except '_'
+KEY is invalid if it contains anything rather than a-z A-Z 0-9 '_'

+any key added to env without a value will be marked is_export so that it will only be printed when export is called and not env
